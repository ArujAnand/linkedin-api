How To Send Messages Using the LinkedIn API
======================================

Introduction
-----------

Sending messages programmatically through LinkedIn can help automate your networking, follow up with connections, or manage communication at scale. In this guide, we'll show you how to use the ``send_message()`` method to send messages to your LinkedIn connections.

Prerequisites
------------

Before you begin, you'll need:

* Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system
* The ``linkedin-api`` package installed
* LinkedIn account credentials
* Existing LinkedIn connections to message

Step 1 — Setting Up the LinkedIn Client
----------------------------------

First, let's import the library and create a client instance:

.. code-block:: python

    from linkedin_api import Linkedin

    # Initialize the API client
    api = Linkedin('your-email@example.com', 'your-password')

Step 2 — Sending a Message to an Existing Conversation
-----------------------------------------------

If you already have a conversation with someone, you can send a message using the conversation URN:

.. code-block:: python

    # Send a message to an existing conversation
    api.send_message(
        message_body="Hi! Thanks for connecting. I'd love to learn more about your work.",
        conversation_urn_id="123456789"
    )

Step 3 — Starting a New Conversation
------------------------------

To start a new conversation with someone, you'll need their profile URN:

.. code-block:: python

    # Start a new conversation
    api.send_message(
        message_body="Hello! I saw your work on AI and would love to connect.",
        recipients=["urn:li:fs_miniProfile:AbC123_dEf"]
    )

Understanding Message Parameters
---------------------------

Here are the key parameters for sending messages:

* **message_body**: The text content of your message (required)
* **conversation_urn_id**: ID of an existing conversation
* **recipients**: List of profile URNs for new conversations

Getting Conversation Details
------------------------

You can fetch details about your conversations:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get all conversations
    conversations = api.get_conversations()

    # Get details of a specific conversation
    conversation = api.get_conversation("123456789")
    
    # Mark a conversation as seen
    api.mark_conversation_as_seen("123456789")

Troubleshooting Common Issues
-------------------------

Here are some common issues you might encounter:

* **Message Not Sent**: Verify the recipient can receive messages
* **Rate Limiting**: LinkedIn limits how many messages you can send
* **Invalid URN**: Double-check conversation and profile URNs
* **Connection Required**: Some users only accept messages from connections

Best Practices and Tips
--------------------

1. **Personalize Your Messages**:

   .. code-block:: python

       # Example of a personalized message
       message = f"""
       Hi {recipient_name},
       
       I noticed your work on {project_name} and would love to discuss it.
       
       Best regards,
       {your_name}
       """

2. **Handle Message Status**:

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           success = api.send_message(
               message_body="Hello!",
               conversation_urn_id="123456789"
           )
           if not success:
               print("Message sent successfully")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Failed to send message: {str(e)}")

3. **Respect LinkedIn's Guidelines**:
   * Don't send too many messages too quickly
   * Avoid spammy or promotional content
   * Respect user privacy settings
